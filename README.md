# Laptop-price-predictor


💻 Laptop Price Prediction

🚀 Overview

This project predicts the price of laptops based on user-provided input features using Machine Learning models. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and deployment as a Streamlit-based web application.
## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle:  
[Laptop Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ganeshmohane/laptop-datacsv)
laptop price predictor with 87% model accuracy with multiple techniques
📌 Features

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends and distributions.

Feature Engineering: Extracting and transforming important attributes.

Model Building: Training multiple ML models for price prediction.

Web App with Streamlit: A user-friendly UI to input features and get predictions.

Deployment: Making the model accessible online.
